I’ve always appreciated the extremely simple and bare bones design of craigslist. I’ve used it for several years to purchase cars, furniture, etc and believe its design makes it very user friendly. One aspect of the website I dislike is the lack of intervention from the site when making a website. Creating more sub categories and item information filters would allow users searching for a specific item to find it quicker instead of scrolling through poorly described or miscategorized items. Another issue I found with the website was located in a state, county, or city that you’re searching in. The site offers a map with small purple dots over certain areas or a large list with every state and region. I believe a search bar where the user could enter a city or zip code would simplify this for the user.

This website offers a wide selection of mods for thousands of video games. I like that this site allows the user to easily find what they’re looking for. There are several categories at the top of the home page along with an easy to find search bar. Although a user can search for what they want, each page is swarmed with ads on all sides of the page. This creates a cluttered and distracting experience. The ads also add to the load times of each page. Each mod is shown along with a thumbnail or picture which also adds to the loading time. To fix this, I would allow the user to change their settings and show mod lists in list form instead of gallery. This would allow the site to display more mods on each page and reduce the load time.

This site has a very simplistic design. The darker screen makes it easier to scroll without straining the users eyes or reducing the screen brightness. While it is simple, it also lacks many features that make content pages easy to navigate. When on a content creator’s page, there is no way to filter videos. To find an unwatched video from months ago, the user must scroll all the way down their page to find it. When finding new pages, there is no filter to find pages that are more tailored towards your interests. I would add these features to allow users to easily find new pages to subscribe to and to navigate subscriptions easier.

I’ve been using this website for avalanche forecasts for several years. The layout is designed to make all information easy to see and interpret. An interactive map allows users to choose which region they will be skiing in and see avalanche danger reports and written descriptions which I really like. What I don’t like is that there is no open forum for people to discuss. Allowing users to discuss amongst one another would help others understand hazards and interpret the information displayed on the site better.

I like the modern design of this website homepage. When a cursor is moved over a picture it moves and the light dims. It gives off the feeling that you’re actually interacting with the website and brings it to life a little. While I enjoy the modern design, I think the home page is somewhat cluttered with large images while it doesn’t offer a lot of hyperlinks to actually access the products which the users are on there to look at. If I was to change anything, I would change the home pages layout to include more links to products. While it’s pretty to look at and enjoyable to use, it lacks functionality in my opinion.
