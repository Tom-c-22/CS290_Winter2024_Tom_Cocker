This would be an interactive website that allows the user to choose their state, river, and season to determine which fly fishing flies are best suitable for the waters they'll be on. The interactive map would offer an alternative method of finding the river and studying the river they'll be fishing. A blog/report page would offer a community based resource for users to discuss any recent insect hatches, catch amounts, and water flow/height status.
