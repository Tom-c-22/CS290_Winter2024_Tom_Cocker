Middle Fork Outfitters Webpage: 

My designs are JPEG files located in a "design" folder. They are simple designs that helped me figure out a basic layout for my site that I could spruce up with some CSS, bootstrap, and jquery. 

Just some small details:

The home page includes a navbar at the top with options to generate a random fly, go to the lessons page, see the request logs, and go to a google map page with a small bit of information. On the main page, there is also three collapsible containers with various info and a tab that takes the user to the top of the screen, back to the random fly generator. 

The lessons page consists of a carousel that has information about casting, reading the river, gear selection, and fly line selection (I didn't want to spend too much time writing generic information).

The fly generator uses and array of flies and a user input season to filter flies matching the season, collecting the fly details, formatting, and displaying that information to the user. There is also a generate button and a close "x" button in the top right. 

The maps page uses a google maps API (no key so it displays "for development purposes only). There is also a small box containing information below it. 

PS: I didn't submit Assignment5 (Server-Side Scripting) because I wanted to impliment this in my final project. I believe my final project covers basic server side scripting implimentations, specifically in my index.js. I'll make sure to mention this in my moodle submission and an email. Thank you for a great term!

Re-Review of sites from Assignment0: 

1. https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites
Going back and looking at the site, I still appreciate the simple, no frills design, but after knowing there are so many
basic CSS styles that can be implimented, I find the design is underwhelming and boring. I think for what the website is built to do, the filtering system and updated map api are great and work well. If I were to change anything about the website it would have to be design/styling elements. I'd add detail to the navigation bar and add a dropdown menu for choosing state and region. This would fix the problem of having every State and Region on the screen at once, forcing the user to go through and find their state. A dropdown menu could filter the user selected state/region and allow them to access the postings easier and quicker. 
I would also add a dropdown menu that contains the specific genre of items they are looking for. If the user could select their genre of item in the dropdown menu, then enter information into the search bar, it would expedite the search process.

My opinion about this website hasn't changed much. The abundance of ads are still gaudy and effect load times. I entered the site and there was a pop up right away which I believe is more tedious for the user than useful. The dropdown options in the navbar are useful and allow the user to find what they're looking for easier. The search bar is also nice for something more specific. Again, I think a main menu option to switch from gallery to list would allow the user to see more information on the screen at a given time instead of pictures. The ads also change size depending on the ad, pushing the site information that the user is trying to access further down the page which greatly impacts readability. Overall though, I think the website is pretty user friendly and the dark mode design with orange highlights is nice and easy to navigate. 

3. https://www.patreon.com/home
Like before, I enjoy the design of this site. The dark mode makes it easier on the eyes and the scroll feature that shows the user memberships is effective and putting what they want to see infront of them without having to search for it. Looking at it now, it's set up a lot more like a social media app when compared to other entertainment/content based websites (twitch, youtube, etc). Its design is more like a mobile app than a webpage which is familiar to everyone and is easy to navigate. Again, I think a more filter options when on a membership would make sense. Filtering if the viewer has viewed/watched the content, a newest-oldest filter, and maybe more categorized posts so the user can find what they're looking for fast. Given that the website is subcription based, I think most users know who they want to subscribe to so filtering options for channels might not be important. I think it'd be nice to include a secondary "homepage" that places curated channels/posts in front of a user. 

4. https://nwac.us/
There are some similar elements that I used for my webpage that this page also uses. In a similar design when my lessons section was a dropdown, it reflected a more similar design to this page. The nav bar elements change color when hovered and the dropdown elements also change when hovered which is makes it more interactive. After using a carousel for my lessons page, I think this site could utilize this on some navigation bar elements to make the page more interactive and enjoyable to use. There isn't a "home" tab when you leave the home page, the user must click on the websites logo in the top left which might not be intuitive to some. On the mainpage, there are several sections that I think should have borders around the container. The information between containers kind of blends together given the white background and light gray headers. I still think it's a information based website and does the job well, I would just spruce up the design a bit to make it easier to navigate and improve readability. 

5. https://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en_US/
Out of the 5, this is by far my favorite page I chose. The design looks great and is seemless. There's a great use of images which dim when hovered which makes the site seem very responsive and alive. The bold headers allow the user to notice key words when scrolling which catches eyes and makes it easy to find what you're looking for. If I were to change anything, it would be the addition of a carousel for the main information on the main page and the middle sections which include items for sale. This would allow the user to cycle through information or products without moving to a completely different page. Before I thought the page was cluttered, but now I find it to be full. It's got content everywhere and has enough blankspace between sections to make it easy to read. The "shop" tab at the top offers enough links to products that the main page can be left to catch the attention and engage the viewer with the informational material and several sections containing products. While it's not perfect, this page, in my opinion, is great!

Review of my own assignments: 

Assignment1: I liked the idea of this site. I was intending on having a large array of flies or to find a dataset of flies and their attributes to use. Then the user can change filters to find a set of flies that would work given the season, weather, region, and water conditions. Looking back, it would've been a lot to take on. The design of the page is very minimal with several photos, small bits of information, and a table. Overall, it's very basic and there's not much I would use from it now. 

Assignment2: I changed up the idea of the website this time and moved towards a more information, instructional based page. I like the idea of a large background image that sets the tone for the website. The seperate boxes at the top to seperate information and links is also nice but the overall implementation wasn't refined. I also used hyperlinks as headers for the sections so the large blue letters were so ugly. I think I used elements of this page regarding the images and navigation style bar at the top for my final project though. 

Assignment3: This page contains many elements that I chose to work with and refine for my final project. I liked the idea of a serach bar that the user could use to find information. The intro page is also something I stuck with for my final but included more and used images as the background to make it more visually appealing. The collapsible containers were also used for my final because they can store information without overloading the screen. 

Assignment4: I chose to use this assignment as a key element of my website. The random fly generator kind of played with the idea I had from assignment1 but uses a smaller array and gives the user something to play around with. I really liked the idea and made it a feature of my final but didn't make it the highlight or key idea behidn the website. The idea of the webpage could've been improved with some better styling and filter options.

Thanks again for a great term. This class was my favorite!
